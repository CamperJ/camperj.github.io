    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The author is not particularly an expert on this topic, however considers themself reasonably knowledgeable and decent at it, 
        and wants to convey any information on the topic that may be of use to others.</p>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>  
        Required materials:
        <ul>
            <li>Resume or curriculum vitae (CV)</li>
            <li>Cover letter (sometimes optional, but generally good to have)</li>
            <li>List of References</li>
        </ul>
        Strategy:<br>
        <strong>Job offers = Applications * (Automated screens pass rate) * (HR screen pass rate) * 
            (Interviews pass rate) ^ (n interview rounds) * (references pass rate) * (background check pass rate)</strong><br>

        As shown in this equation, unfortunately any principal factor can wipe out the others if its value is 0, 
        for example if a candidate gets through all of the interviews but then doesn't pass the background check.<br>

        The goal then is to work on each successive factor until it is passed, and then work on the next one, until all factors are >0.
