# camperj.github.io --> akrasia.xyz

Hello World!

Although humble and amateurish, this is my first (and hopefully not my last) serious code-related project.

camperj.github.io, now akrasia.xyz, is my personal website that will hopefully contain interesting information that is useful to any readers. Some of it may be by or about the author, but other content may be referenced from external sources (cited appropriately of course). It is the intention of the author for this site to be a long-running project with increasing value over time.
