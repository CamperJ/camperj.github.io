    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The author is an engineer (not a software developer by training) who hopes to learn and exercise the skills needed to create something of <i>significant</i> utility for other people. <br />
        This is but an early step towards that goal. <br />
        <br/>
        Further content TBD.</p>
    <h3 id="Purpose">Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site, and this endeavor more generally, is ultimately improvement of human quality of life (QOL) of a significant and wide-reaching scale.<br />
    That aim is not unique to this site's author, but I hope to make my own personal contributions to the effort.</p>
